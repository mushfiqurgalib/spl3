# Brain Tumor Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Accurate segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and treating brain tumors, and this project utilizes state-of-the-art techniques in medical image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in segmentation tasks.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implemented using the U-Net architecture, which is well-suited for biomedical image segmentation.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced model robustness through various data augmentation techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilizes Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Index, and pixel accuracy to evaluate segmentation performance.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools for inspecting segmentation results on MRI images.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-segmentation.git
   cd brain-tumor-segmentation
2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3.Install the required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [insert dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, BraTS]. It includes:

MRI scans of brain images in various formats (e.g., NIfTI).
Ground truth segmentation masks for training the model.
Data Preparation
Instructions on how to preprocess the data can be found in the data_preprocessing.py file.

## Model Architecture
This project employs the U-Net architecture, which consists of:

Encoder: Downsampling path for capturing context.
Bottleneck: Bridge between encoder and decoder.
Decoder: Upsampling path for precise localization.
Refer to the model.py file for detailed implementation of the U-Net architecture.

## Usage
To train the model, run:

python train.py --data_dir <path_to_dataset> --epochs <number_of_epochs>
To evaluate the model, run:


python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --data_dir <path_to_test_data>

## Results
The results of the segmentation model can be visualized using the visualize.py script. The following metrics will be displayed:

Dice Coefficient
Jaccard Index
Sample segmentation results
