# Brain Tumor Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Accurate segmentation is crucial for diagnosing and treating brain tumors, and this project utilizes state-of-the-art techniques in medical image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in segmentation tasks.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implemented using the U-Net architecture, which is well-suited for biomedical image segmentation.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced model robustness through various data augmentation techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilizes Dice Coefficient, Jaccard Index, and pixel accuracy to evaluate segmentation performance.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools for inspecting segmentation results on MRI images.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-segmentation.git
   cd brain-tumor-segmentation
2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3.Install the required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
